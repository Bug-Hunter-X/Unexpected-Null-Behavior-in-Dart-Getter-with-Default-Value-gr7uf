# Unexpected Null Behavior in Dart Getter with Default Value

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null safety and default values in Dart getters. The issue arises when a getter uses the null-aware operator (??) to provide a default value when the underlying variable is null. While this approach might seem straightforward, it can mask potential problems and lead to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file demonstrates the corrected approach.

## Bug Description
The getter `myVariable` uses `?? 0` to return 0 if `_myVariable` is null. While this prevents a runtime error, it can hide the fact that the underlying variable is unexpectedly null, possibly stemming from an error elsewhere in the code.  Effective error handling requires explicit null checks rather than relying on defaults to cover potential errors.
